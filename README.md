# Multi-Agent-Ethical-Reinforcement-Learning
## Thesis project for training agents to behave ethically using Deep Reinforcement Learning



### Environment

The environment used is the Lumberjack-v0 environment from https://github.com/koulanurag/ma-gym. In this environment two agents/lumberjacks are rewarded when they cut a tree. When the tree strenght of a tree is equal to 2, it takes two agents to cut the tree togeter. I slightly modified this environment, so that all tree strengths are equal to 1, so cooperation is not an element of the environment anymore. Also, instead of two equal agents, I made one 'weak' agent and one 'strong' agent. The weak agent can only cut trees in a certain percentage of the time. This percentage is yet to be determined. 

### Ethical Value Embedding

An ethical objective was added to the lumberjacks environment, according to the method of Rodriguez-Soto et al. (2022). Using this method, the agents were trained to behave ethically, and each cut an equal amount of trees.

### Value Decomposition Network

The agents are trained using a Value Decomposition Network. This algorithm is found in vdn.py. The one used here is from https://github.com/koulanurag/minimal-marl. 

### File Descriptions

**lumberjacks.py** Used for running the vdn algorithm. Paste in here which version of the Lumberjacks environment you want to use. 
**lumberjacks_ethial.py** Lumberjacks environment with ethical embedding. This version trains two agents using the same reward function. 
**lumberjacks_ethial2.py** Lumberjacks environment with ethical embedding. This version trains two agents using different reward functions. 
**lumberjacks_strong_strong.py** Lumberjacks environment with no ethical embedding and two equally strong agents. 
**lumberjacks_weak_strong.py** Lumberjacks environment with no ethical embedding and a weak and a strong angent. 
**vdn_ethical.py** Value decomposition network adjusted to the ethical lumberjacks environments. This implementation is for training the agents using the same reward function.  
**vdn_ethical.py** Value decomposition network adjusted to the ethical lumberjacks environments. This implementation is for training the agents using different reward functions.
